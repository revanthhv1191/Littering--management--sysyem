Littering Detection & Vehicle Number Plate Recognition System
Overview
In many cities, the problem of littering from moving vehicles is growing. Traditional surveillance systems struggle to catch these events in real-time and identify the culprits. This project aims to solve this issue using a computer vision pipeline that performs the following:

Plastic Waste Detection – A YOLOv8 model trained to detect plastic items such as bottles and wrappers thrown from vehicles.
Vehicle Detection – Identifies and localizes the vehicle responsible for the action using a separate YOLOv8 model.
License Plate Detection and OCR – The number plate is detected from the vehicle region, cropped, and passed to an OCR module to extract the alphanumeric registration number.
Data Logging and Evidence Storage – Cropped images of the plastic waste, vehicle, and number plate are saved along with the recognized text for further verification or legal action.
Real-time Feed Processing – The system works on a live video stream or recorded footage for continuous monitoring.
This solution can be used by municipal bodies and smart city projects to automate litter detection, issue fines, and build a cleaner environment.

🧰 How it Works
Video Feed Input

Either live camera or pre-recorded footage.
Object Detection

Detects vehicles and litter using YOLOv8 models.
Littering Check

Identifies if trash is being thrown outside of a detected vehicle's bounding box.
License Plate Recognition

Localizes the number plate region and extracts text using Tesseract OCR.
Logging

Stores images and OCR results with timestamp for each littering event.
